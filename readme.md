2018/2019 Compilers Coursework
==============================

There is a single assessed code deliverable. This deliverable contains three components:

- [*Test suite*]: A bash script that runs the basic C funcionality tests in test_deliverable/test_cases.

- [*C-translator*]: This compiler is able to translate a sub-set of C into equivalent Python. 

- [*C-compiler*]: This is a compiler from C to MIPS assembly.
  
In all cases, the source language is pre-processed C90. The target environment is Ubuntu 16.04.
